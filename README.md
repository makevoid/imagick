# Go Imagick

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v2/imagick?status.svg)](https://gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v2/imagick)

Go Imagick is a Go bind to ImageMagick's MagickWand C API.

We support two compatibility branches:

```
master (tag v2.x.x): >= ImageMagick 6.8.9-9
legacy (tag v1.x.x): <= ImageMagick 6.8.9-8
```

They map, respectively, through gopkg.in:

```
gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v2/imagick
gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v1/imagick
```

# Install

## Mac OS X

### MacPorts

```
sudo port install ImageMagick
```

## Ubuntu / Debian

```
sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
```

## Common

Check if pkg-config is able to find the right ImageMagick include and libs:

```
pkg-config --cflags --libs MagickWand
```

Then go get it:

```
go get gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v2/imagick
```

### Build tags

If you want to specify CGO_CFLAGS/CGO_LDFLAGS manually at build time, such as for building statically or without pkg-config, you can use the "no_pkgconfig" build tag:

```
go build -tags no_pkgconfig gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v2/imagick
```

# Examples

The examples folder is full with usage examples ported from C ones found in here: http://members.shaw.ca/el.supremo/MagickWand/

# Quick and partial example

Since this is a CGO binding, Go GC does not manage memory allocated by the C API then is necessary to use Terminate() and Destroy() methods.
But objects of MagickWand, DrawingWand, PixelIterator and PixelWand are managed by GO GC if you create them by constructors.

```
package main

import "gopkg.in/gographics/imagick.v2/imagick"

func main() {
    imagick.Initialize()
    defer imagick.Terminate()

    mw := imagick.NewMagickWand()

    ...
}
```

If you use struct literals, you should free resources manually:

```
package main

import "github.com/gographics/imagick/imagick"

func main() {
    imagick.Initialize()
    defer imagick.Terminate()

    mw := imagick.MagickWand{...}
    defer mw.Destroy()

    ...
}
```

Both methods are compatible if constructor methods used:

```
package main

import "github.com/gographics/imagick/imagick"

func main() {
    imagick.Initialize()
    defer imagick.Terminate()

    mw := imagick.NewMagickWand()
    defer mw.Destroy()

    ...
}
```

But you should NOT mix two ways of object creation:
```
package main

import "github.com/gographics/imagick/imagick"

func main() {
    imagick.Initialize()
    defer imagick.Terminate()

    mw1 := imagick.MagickWand{...}
    defer mw1.Destroy()

    mw2 := imagick.NewMagickWand()

    ...
}
```
