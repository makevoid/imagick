# gifmagic

gifmagic creates a gif from a json text stream


status: unfinished, using ruby version because Nx times faster? there's something strange here, libmagick not well installed? or it's just loaded slowly probably, a go server would be faster maybe than a ruby one but I need the startup to be fast as well atm - # TODO go back and re-evaluate a go server eventually
